The main reasons for not using the existing capacities of the industrial unit are the unbalanced production and assembly lines. Customers tend to produce, and manufacturers are forced to offer a wide range of products simultaneously on the production line, as production systems become larger and their components and interrelationships increase, their complexity has already increased to such an extent that the decision-making process of control guidance made it very sensitive and difficult. In this research, looking for a new method to solve the problem of arranging facilities, looking for the efficient arrangement of facilities in a specific area, according to the cost of moving materials and the distance of each facility, taking into account practical aspects, such as the location of each facility, The entrance/exit of each unit and the orientation of the facility is from the center in a certain area with a number of obstacles and corridors, because these problems are part of the np-hard problem, by using three meta-heuristic methods that optimize the mating of barnacles, slime mold algorithm and predator algorithm. Sea in a two-dimensional space seeks to minimize the cost of moving materials. These three methods are compared according to the cost of moving the materials and the approximate execution time. Finally, according to the test results of each of the three algorithms and compared to the genetic algorithm, slime mold algorithm with the amount of material transportation cost is 12005, the barnacle mating algorithm. With a value of 15,300, the marine predator algorithm with a value of 17,643, and a genetic algorithm with a value of 18,404, compared to the solution of the genetic method, the barnacle mating algorithm has made significant changes and has wide applications for production systems, hospitals, schools, and airports
